### _The Right Way to Plan your Week's Meals_

[MealPlan](https://week-meal-plan.netlify.app/) is a web app that allows you to plan your meals for the week, by creating recipes and their corresponding ingredients and adding them to the day you'll be eating that.

With MealPlan, you don't need to worry about signups or account creation, you can get started right from the main page. MealPlan allows you to share your weekly schedule with family members, roommates, friends, or anyone who you might want to share it with.
Also, no need to worry about making your grocery list yourself anymore, MealPlan does that for you using the recipes you add each day.

#### What I used to make it

To make MealPlan, I used RedwoodJS, a full-stack web framework that uses a React frontend, GraphQL backend, and Prisma to design the DB. The frontend and backend are written in TypeScript. Currently the DB is hosted on Railway using PostgreSQL and the web app is hosted on Netlify.
